# Deeplab ADE20K inference (Tensorflow 2)
Python program to visualize the results from the Deeplab model (trained on **ADE20K dataset**).

## Required Python packages
* **numpy**: For the array calculations.
* **tensorflow**: Tensorflow 2.
* **Pillow**: To read the image.
* **Matplotlib**: To plot the results.

## HOW TO USE
* Download the required packages.
* Download the model from the [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/model_zoo.md). **ONLY model trained in ADE20K**
* Change the name of the path to the model (model_path) and the image (img_path) you want to test.
* Run the program.
